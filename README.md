# Simplifying Email Automation with Python and Microsoft Graph API


In today's digital landscape, automating email workflows is essential for efficiency and productivity. Traditional methods often involve security challenges, such as storing plaintext credentials. A more secure and modern approach utilizes the Microsoft Graph API in conjunction with Python's msal and requests libraries. This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough to help administrators and developers, even those with minimal coding experience, set up and use this solution.

Why Choose Microsoft Graph API?

Microsoft Graph API offers a unified programmability model that integrates with various Microsoft services. By leveraging OAuth 2.0 for authentication, it eliminates the need to store plaintext credentials, enhancing security and compliance.

Step 1: Registering Your Application in Azure

Access Azure Portal:
Navigate to the Microsoft Azure Portal and sign in with your credentials.

App Registration:

Go to Azure Active Directory > App registrations > New registration.
Enter a name for your application (e.g., "EmailAutomationApp").
Under Supported account types, select the appropriate option based on your organization's needs.
For Redirect URI, choose "Web" and enter http://localhost (this can be adjusted later as needed).
Click Register.
Application (Client) ID and Directory (Tenant) ID:
After registration, note the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID; these will be required in your Python script.

Client Secret:

Navigate to Certificates & secrets > New client secret.
Provide a description (e.g., "EmailAutomationSecret") and set an expiration period.
Click Add and copy the generated secret value immediately; it will not be displayed again.
API Permissions:

Go to API permissions > Add a permission > Microsoft Graph > Application permissions.
Search for and select Mail.Send.
Click Add permissions.
Ensure to grant admin consent for the added permissions.
Step 2: Setting Up Your Python Environment

Install Python:
Download and install the latest version of Python from the official website.

Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):

Open your command prompt or terminal.
Navigate to your project directory.
Run:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:
bash
Copy code
.\env\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source env/bin/activate
Install Required Libraries:
With the virtual environment activated, install the necessary libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install msal requests
